# Brain Tumor Segmentation Using YOLOv11 and SAM2

## Project Description
This project focuses on using advanced computer vision models, **YOLOv11** and **SAM2**, to segment brain tumors in medical images for improved diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv11**: Real-time object detection model for identifying multiple objects.
- **SAM2**: Model for precise segmentation of objects.
- **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**.
